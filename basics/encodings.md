ASCII/UTF-8: "Hello"

Each character corresponds to a specific numeric code:
H (72), e (101), l (108), l (108), o (111)
This is the human-readable form

Uint8Array: [72, 101, 108, 108, 111]

Direct numeric representation of each character
Useful for manipulating raw byte data in programming

Base58: 9Ajdvzr

Process:
a. Convert Uint8Array to large integer: 310939249775 ( concatenate byte values)
b. Repeatedly divide by 58, collect remainders
c. Map remainders to Base58 alphabet
Advantages:

More compact than hex
Avoids similar-looking characters (0, O, I, l)

Often used in cryptocurrencies

Base64: SGVsbG8=

Process:
a. Convert to binary: 010010000110010101101100011011000110111
b. Group into 6 bits: 010010 000110 010101 101100 011011 000110 111000
c. Convert groups to decimal: 18 6 21 44 27 6 56
d. Map to Base64 alphabet: SGVsbG8
e. Add padding '=' if needed
Advantages:

Efficient for encoding binary data as text
Widely supported in various protocols

Hexadecimal: 48656C6C6F

Process:
a. Convert each byte to two hex digits
b. Concatenate results
Advantages:

Direct representation of byte values
Easy to convert to/from binary

Commonly used in programming and low-level system interactions

Key Considerations:

Data size changes:

ASCII/UTF-8: 5 bytes
Uint8Array: 5 bytes
Base58: 7 characters
Base64: 8 characters (including padding)
Hexadecimal: 10 characters

Base64 and Base58 are useful for transmitting binary data in text-based systems
Hexadecimal is often used for human-readable representation of binary data
Each encoding has specific use cases in different areas of computing and data transmission
