## Why Blockchain?

**Watch Big Short Movie**

- Inflating currencies -> Governments keep printing money -> Value of money decreases -> Inflation
- 2008 Financial Crisis -> Banks were bailed out by government using Taxpayer money -> People lost trust in banks and government -> Fractional Reserve Banking -> Banks lend your money -> Banks can go bankrupt
- INR and JPY depreciating as inflation in US increases
- Holding cash -> losers bet
- Holding Assets (Gold,Stock) -> winners bet
- Currencies are not backed by gold anymore
- Even creating a new currency is not a solution as it will still be centralized.

### Solution

- Decentralized Currency -> Bitcoin
- Underlying Technology -> Blockchain which uses Hashing like SHA256
