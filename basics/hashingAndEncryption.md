### Hashing

Hashing is a process of converting an input (like a string) into a fixed-length string of bytes. A hash function is a function that takes an input and returns

Common hashing algorithms - SHA-256, MD5

### Encryption

Encryption is the process of converting data into a form that is unreadable without a decryption key. It is used to protect sensitive information during transmission or storage.

- Symmetric encryption: Uses a single key for both encryption and decryption. Examples include AES, DES.

- Asymmetric encryption: Uses a pair of keys (public and private) for encryption and decryption. Examples include RSA, ECC.
