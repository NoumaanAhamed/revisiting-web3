Making Transactions -> Signing the transaction with the private key and broadcasting it to the network. The Blockchain network verifies the transaction using the public key and adds it to the blockchain. ( or vice versa, encrypt with public key and decrypt with private key )
The miner who adds the transaction(along with signatures) to the blockchain gets a reward for it ( from coinbase )
